                                    To solve this question, firstly, we have to find what distance was covered during the first \(1.5 h\) by substituting the speed equation with the values given: 
                                    $$v = \frac{s}{t}$$
                                    $$70 \frac{km}{h} = \frac{s}{1.5 h}$$
                                    $$s = 105 km$$
                                    <center> Now we can find the distance left for the last hour </center>
                                    $$v = \frac{(120 - 105) km}{(2.5 - 1.5) h}$$
                                    $$v = 15 \frac{km}{h}$$ <br><hr>

                                moving in a straight line with a velocity–time

                                    From the graph we can conclude that at the beggining the object is moving at a constant negative velocity which means that it is backing from the initial place, 
                                    then the velocity value suddenly changes to the exact opposite which means that it is moving forward untill it comes to the same place:
